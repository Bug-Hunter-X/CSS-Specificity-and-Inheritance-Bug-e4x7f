The solution involves using more specific selectors or the `!important` flag (though `!important` should be used sparingly) to explicitly control the style application:

```css
div {
  color: blue;
}

p {
  color: red;
}

div p {
  color: green !important; /* Or adjust selectors for better specificity */
}
```

Alternatively, a more structured approach with better defined classes might improve clarity and maintainability:

```css
.container {
  color: blue;
}

.special-paragraph {
  color: red;
}

.container .special-paragraph {
  color: green;
}
```

In this version, classes directly control styles, making it more maintainable and easier to predict.
